#  Analysis of Mean Differences


## Impetus

This topic focuses on analysis of means, as either equating the mean value of one data set to a constant, the equality of two data sets, or the equality of several treatments within a data set.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  
 - Understand rejection regions and describe how they change due to the alternative hypothsis.  
 - Execute an analysis of mean values for a single or dual set of samples using the Student's t-test.
 - Perform an analysis of Variance to test the equality of two or more means based upon one or more predictor variables.
 - Apply the Tukey's test to determine which set of means are actually different in an analysis of variance.
